# PickblockPlus

This addon adds in a Pickblock Debug stick, a creative mode item that allows any user to pick a block's full data by right clicking it.

"why would I use this? this function already exists ingame" Well, it does, however you have to play with a Keyboard in order to be fully able to use it. This addon allows that functionality to work for any player using any form of controlls.
